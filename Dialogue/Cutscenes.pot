msgstr "You're the kid who's applying for a job, right?"

msgid "CUTSCENE_PLAYERCREATION_D5"
msgstr "Great!"

msgid "CUTSCENE_PLAYERCREATION_D6"
msgstr "I'll have you journey across the region, collecting specimens for my research. Along the way, you're sure to encounter all kinds of people. Some will be willing to cooperate and some not, but you should try and be friendly with everybody. We don't want a bad reputation, right? People will ask for your help solving mysteries or lending them a hand when they're down. And it won't be easy --- there's dangers everywhere. Whether it be wild creatures or people with ill intent, you'll need to be on your guard. But keep a clear head on your shoulders, kid, and I'm sure you'll pull through just fine."

msgstr "We humans share this world with creatures known as Pokémon. More than mere animals, Pokémon possess astonishing powers and remarkable intelligence. People and Pokémon coexist in many ways. Some Pokémon are kept as pets, others help us with work, and still others are used in battle by Trainers such as yourself."

msgid "CUTSCENE_PLAYERCREATION_D8"
msgstr "But there's so much we still don't know about Pokémon. That's my job! I study Pokémon for a living. Specifically, I'm an expert on Pokémon elements. Every Pokémon has an elemental type, and each type has its own strengths and weaknesses. But... why do they exist? Are there new types we haven't discovered yet? Ah, but I'll tell you more at your first day on the job. Report to my lab tomorrow to get your first Pokémon. Now, if you'd just fill out this form here..."

msgid "CUTSCENE_INTRO_D8"
msgstr "As part of a routine inspection, they brought in a specialist to take a look at the electrical system."

msgid "CUTSCENE_INTRO_D9"
msgstr "Cameron, have you finished your diagnostics?"

msgid "CUTSCENE_INTRO_D10"

msgid "CUTSCENE_INTRO_D11"
msgstr "Excellent."

msgid "CUTSCENE_INTRO_D12"
msgstr "If everybody has finished their work, we'll break for lunch."

msgid "CUTSCENE_INTRO_D13"
msgstr "Uh, boss... You might want to take a look at this."

msgid "CUTSCENE_INTRO_D14"
msgstr "Strange... The temperature readings are far higher than normal. Either we need to reset the thermometer, or... The reactor is leaking a massive amount of heat..."

msgid "CUTSCENE_INTRO_D15"
msgstr "It can't be the thermometer I just checked that. So..."

msgid "CUTSCENE_INTRO_D16"
msgstr "There must be a breach in the reactor! At this temperature, in just a few minutes, we'll have a total meltdown!"

msgid "CUTSCENE_INTRO_D17"
msgstr "Everybody needs to evacuate! NOW!"

msgid "CUTSCENE_INTRO_D18"
msgstr "Lucille! You have to leave, too!"

msgid "CUTSCENE_INTRO_D19"

msgid "CUTSCENE_INTRO_D21"
msgstr "With Cameron's help, all of the scientists were able to escape unscathed... except Lucille."

msgid "CUTSCENE_INTRO_D22"
msgstr "She was never seen again after that day..."

msgid "CUTSCENE_INTRO_D23"
msgstr "The radiation leaking from the broken reactor made the surrounding area uninhabitable for many years, foiling any attempt to try and search for her."

msgid "CUTSCENE_INTRO_D24"
msgstr "The lost of his wife had a profound effect on Kellyn. His personality changed. He became cold, and dedicated to his job. In time, he got promoted to Chief of the Tandor Pokémon Rangers. However, he became too busy to care for his child. So young \PN was sent to live with their elderly Auntie in Moki Town."

msgid "CUTSCENE_INTRO_D25"
msgstr "10 years passed..."

msgid "CUTSCENE_INTRO_D26"
msgstr "Auntie's health waned. Supporting a child was too much work for her. Fortunately, Ernest Bamb'o, the local Pokémon Professor, was looking for a research assistant. Two kids from Moki Town applied: \PN, and their childhood friend, Theo. It was common for youths of a certain age to receive a Pokémon and travel the region as a Pokémon Trainer. And so, \PN's journey began..."
